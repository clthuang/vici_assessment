## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-07T00:15:00.000Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (4 blockers, 6 warnings, 3 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [format] Skill file must be SKILL.md with `name` and `description` frontmatter, 200-char description limit (at: Section 1, Section 6)
  Suggestion: Update deliverable constraints and file structure to use SKILL.md with proper frontmatter
- [blocker] [feasibility] P1-6 CVE checking infeasible -- GitHub Advisory Database does not index GITHUB_ACTIONS as an ecosystem (at: P1-6)
  Suggestion: Use repo security advisories via gh api, or zizmor as primary, with Claude knowledge as fallback
- [blocker] [testability] P0-3 root cause analysis acceptance criteria not testable -- no concrete scenarios per category (at: P0-3)
  Suggestion: Add specific test scenarios mapping log patterns to failure categories
- [blocker] [completeness] Spec missing success metrics section entirely (at: global)
  Suggestion: Add success metrics section mapping PRD metrics to testable criteria
- [warning] [security] Prompt injection from CI logs not fully testable (at: P0-NF3)
  Suggestion: Acknowledged as open risk; triaging rules are primary defense
- [warning] [consistency] Tier 4 includes `gh secret set` which contradicts read-only audit scope (at: Section 5.1)
  Suggestion: Remove secret management from tier table
- [warning] [scope] V2 scope (P2/P3) has acceptance criteria but no clear boundary on what's NOT in V2 (at: Section 3)
  Suggestion: Add explicit "V2 does not include..." boundary
- [warning] [completeness] No log truncation handling specified (at: P0)
  Suggestion: Add NFR for handling oversized log output
- [warning] [traceability] Some requirements lack explicit traceability to PRD sections (at: global)
  Suggestion: Minor; spec covers all PRD MVP features
- [warning] [permissions] No explicit permissions matrix for gh CLI commands (at: P0, P1)
  Suggestion: Document minimum required GitHub token scopes

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed Section 1 and Section 6: Updated to SKILL.md with `name` and `description` frontmatter, 200-char limit documented
- Fixed P1-6: Replaced GraphQL Advisory DB query with layered approach (zizmor → repo security advisories → Claude knowledge with caveat)
- Fixed P0-3: Added 6 concrete test scenarios mapping log patterns to failure categories
- Added Section 9: Success Metrics with 6 verifiable metrics (SM-1 through SM-6)
- Fixed Tier 4/5: Removed `gh secret set` and `gh secret delete` (out of scope for this skill)
- Added P0-NF4: Log truncation handling (focus on last 200 lines per failing step)

## Stage 2: Phase Review - 2026-02-07T00:20:00.000Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] [completeness] No GitHub token scopes documented for gh CLI commands (at: Section 7)
  Suggestion: Add token scope mapping (actions:read, security_events:read, actions:write)
- [warning] [clarity] P1-3 hardcoded secret detection patterns not specified (at: P1-3)
  Suggestion: Add example regex patterns or state Claude's language understanding will be used
- [warning] [traceability] Anti-patterns 5-8 not mapped to P1-N requirement rows (at: Section 2.2)
  Suggestion: Add note that items 5-8 are covered by general audit scope (P1-7)
- [warning] [scope] V2 scope boundary not explicitly stated (at: Section 3)
  Suggestion: Add note about whether MVP design should include V2 extension points
- [suggestion] [format] P0-4 proposed fix output format not specified (at: P0-4)
  Suggestion: Specify markdown code blocks with diff format
- [suggestion] [consistency] Section 6 skeleton includes V2 sections but spec is MVP-scoped (at: Section 6)
  Suggestion: Add note about V2 stubs being optional in MVP
- [suggestion] [clarity] SM-2 "single interaction" conflicts with P0-6 back-and-forth for ambiguous requests (at: SM-2)
  Suggestion: Clarify SM-2 covers diagnosis only (P0-1 through P0-3), not fix application

**Summary:** Spec is well-structured and comprehensive for MVP scope. All four previous blockers resolved. Remaining issues are warnings and suggestions -- none prevent a designer from proceeding. Approved for design.

**Changes Made:**
- Added GitHub token scopes sub-section (Section 6) mapping commands to required scopes
- Specified P1-3 detection patterns: known regex formats, YAML key patterns, Claude understanding
- Mapped anti-pattern checklist items 1-8 to P1-N requirements explicitly
- Added V2 boundary statement and "V2 does NOT include" list
- Specified P0-4 output format: 3-part (explanation, code block, approval)
- Added V2 stub markers in skeleton ("V2 - not implemented")
- Clarified SM-2 scope: diagnosis only, fix steps may need confirmation

## Stage 2: Phase Review (re-review) - 2026-02-07T00:25:00.000Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [suggestion] [formatting] Section numbering gap (3 to 5) after removing Future Scope section (at: Table of contents)
  Suggestion: Renumber sections to eliminate gap

**Changes Made:**
- Renumbered sections: removed standalone Section 4 (Future Scope, already covered by Section 3), renumbered 5→4, 6→5, 7→6, 8→7, 9→8, 10→9. Updated internal cross-references.

**Summary:** All previous warnings and suggestions resolved. Spec is complete and ready for design phase. Only observation was a minor section numbering gap, now fixed.

## Risk Section Addition - 2026-02-07T00:30:00.000Z

**Action:** User requested risks, failure modes, and security analysis section.

**Added Section 9 with:**
- 9.1 Risk Register: 10 risks (R-1 through R-10) with likelihood/impact/mitigation/residual
- 9.2 Failure Modes: 8 modes with triggers, behaviors, and recovery
- 9.3 Security Considerations: access scope, security invariants with verification linkage
- 9.4 Residual Risk Summary: 5 items that cannot be fully mitigated

**Phase Review of Section 9:**
- Approved with 3 warnings and 3 suggestions (all addressed)
- Added R-10 (concurrent usage risk)
- Added failure mode for insufficient auth scopes
- Added testability linkage (SM-7 through SM-9) for security invariants
- Added PromptPwnd reference to R-1
- Added YAML expression handling note to R-7
- Updated residual risk #5 with testing baseline reference

## Triple Review (PRD + UX + Brainstorm) - 2026-02-07T00:35:00.000Z

**Reviewers:** PRD reviewer, UX/Design reviewer, Brainstorm reviewer

### PRD Reviewer: Approved
- All PRD MVP requirements covered, no scope creep
- Spec more disciplined about scope than PRD (good)
- Section numbering inconsistency flagged

### Brainstorm Reviewer: Ready (Coherence 5/5, Scope 5/5, Pain Points 4/5)
- All 4 value propositions from PRD have spec coverage
- actionlint scope ambiguity flagged

### UX Reviewer: Not Approved (2 blockers, 8 warnings)
- Blocker 1: Over-engineered ~3x for a markdown prompt file
- Blocker 2: P0 doesn't solve push-wait-fail cycle (delivers faster diagnosis, not cycle elimination)
- Warning: Triaging contract too formal (6 tiers vs 3 rules)
- Warning: "Fix my CI" requires too many confirmations
- Warning: V2 placeholders waste tokens in SKILL.md
- Warning: Token scopes table unnecessary maintenance
- Warning: Error Handling and Failure Modes redundant
- Warning: P1 delta over zizmor unclear
- Warning: Missing pre-push validation concept
- Note: Section numbering inconsistencies

### Changes Made (addressing UX blocker + warnings):
1. Added honest P0 value proposition: "delivers faster diagnosis, not cycle elimination"
2. Added P1 delta over zizmor: "enriches zizmor output with codebase context + remediation"
3. Simplified triaging contract: 3 behavioral rules + reference table (was 6 formal tiers)
4. Fixed P0-6: "fix my CI" now diagnoses + proposes in one shot, single confirm before write
5. Removed V2 placeholders from SKILL.md template
6. Removed token scopes table (replaced with note about error-driven scope discovery)
7. Merged Error Handling + Failure Modes into single table (Section 8)
8. Clarified actionlint MVP role: optional validation after P0-5 writes
9. Fixed all subsection numbering (3.1/3.2, 4.1/4.2, 10.1/10.2/10.3)
10. Noted pre-push validation as future consideration in P0 value proposition

### Not Changed (deliberate):
- Did not add pre-push validation as new scope (would need brainstorm evaluation)
- Did not collapse spec to ~80 lines (spec serves as reference for design/implementation, not just SKILL.md authoring)
- Kept risk register at 10 items (user explicitly requested comprehensive risk analysis)
- Kept 9 success metrics (SM-7/8/9 were specifically added per user request for security analysis)

## Triple Review Round 2 (PRD + UX + Brainstorm) - 2026-02-07T00:45:00.000Z

**Reviewers:** PRD reviewer, UX/Design reviewer, Brainstorm reviewer

### PRD Reviewer: NOT Approved (1 blocker, 5 warnings)
- Blocker: PRD/spec conflict on P0-6 -- PRD says "fix my CI" → "diagnose only" while spec says "diagnose + propose in one shot"
- Warning: Stale tier references in risk register (Tier 3+, Tier 4, Tier 0+1)
- Warning: Value prop vs SM-2 disconnect
- Warning: PRD decision tree still shows old P0-6 flow
- Warning: PRD test scenario says "must diagnose only, not edit files"
- Warning: Section numbering minor inconsistency

### UX Reviewer: Approved (3 warnings)
- Warning: PRD/spec inconsistency on P0-6 (same as PRD reviewer blocker)
- Warning: `gh run view --log-failed` has known reliability issues (GitHub CLI #10551)
- Warning: Multiple concurrent failures behavior undefined for P0-6
- Note: Stale tier references in risk register

### Brainstorm Reviewer: Ready (5/5 coherence, 5/5 scope, 5/5 pain points)
- Warning: PRD/spec drift on P0-6
- Warning: Stale tier references in spec

### Changes Made (addressing PRD blocker + all warnings):
1. Updated PRD ambiguity resolution table: "Fix my CI" → "Diagnose + propose fix in one response" instead of "Diagnose only"
2. Updated PRD test scenario: "Fix my CI" → "must diagnose and propose fix, but ask before writing/executing" (was "must diagnose only, not edit files")
3. Fixed R-1: Replaced "Tier 3+" with "Rule 2 (write/execute confirmation) and Rule 3 (destructive double confirmation)"
4. Fixed R-5: Replaced "Tier 4" with "Rule 2" and reference to Section 5.2 ambiguity resolution
5. Fixed R-10: Replaced "Tier 4 reruns" with "execute-class reruns (Rule 2)"
6. Fixed Security Invariant #2: Replaced "Tier 0+1" with "read + analyze (Rule 1)"

### Not Changed (deliberate):
- `gh run view --log-failed` reliability: Acknowledged as known issue but out of scope for spec -- skill already handles empty log output in Section 8 failure modes
- Multiple concurrent failures: P0-6 handles one diagnosis flow at a time per normal Claude conversation context. Concurrent failure handling is standard Claude behavior, not skill-specific

## Design Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-07T01:25:00.000Z

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (2 blockers, 6 warnings, 3 notes)

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [consistency] plugin.json placement wrong -- must be at plugin root, not .claude-plugin/ (at: Section 1 - Plugin Directory Structure)
  Challenge: Plugin discovery will fail with current structure
- [blocker] [feasibility] P1 Step 4 gh api security-advisories returns self-reported advisories only, not a vulnerability database -- will usually return empty (at: Section 2.5, Section 3 P1 flow)
  Challenge: Data flow misrepresents API reliability as primary path
- [warning] [completeness] gh run view --log-failed has known reliability issues (#10551), needs fallback to --log (at: P0 Step 3)
- [warning] [completeness] Checkbox UI doesn't work in terminal context (at: P0 output format)
- [warning] [completeness] Missing {owner}/{repo} resolution mechanism (at: P1 multiple steps)
- [warning] [assumptions] Description string differs from spec; spec version includes "trading systems" (at: Section 2.2)
- [warning] [consistency] No bypass path when user provides specific run ID (at: P0 Steps 1-2)
- [warning] [completeness] P1-3 regex patterns from spec not placed in security-checklist.md (at: Section 2.6)
- [note] Sequential API calls for action repos could be slow with many actions
- [note] T7 injection test too simplistic -- should include subtle remediation-style injections
- [note] Auto-triggering "~20% activation rate" claim unsourced

**Changes Made:**
1. Fixed plugin.json location: Clarified it goes at plugin root (github-claude-skills/plugin.json), added registration note
2. Fixed P1 vulnerability check: Reframed gh api as supplementary (usually empty), zizmor and Claude knowledge as primary sources
3. Added --log-failed fallback: Try --log-failed first, if empty fall back to --log with P0-NF4 truncation
4. Replaced checkbox UI with numbered text options (terminal-compatible)
5. Added {owner}/{repo} resolution: `gh repo view --json owner,name` in preamble
6. Aligned description with spec: "Diagnose GitHub Actions failures, audit workflow security, and fix CI/CD pipelines for trading systems." (97 chars)
7. Added run-ID bypass: Step 1 skips to Step 3 when user provides specific run ID
8. Added P1-3 regex patterns to security-checklist.md design (AWS keys, GitHub PATs, YAML key patterns)
9. Added design-specific risks for --log-failed reliability and empty API responses
10. Sourced auto-triggering claim to Scott Spence blog post

## Handoff Review - 2026-02-07T01:30:00.000Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] P0 step numbering inconsistent between component model (5 steps), interface table (6 steps), and data flow (5 items) (at: Sections 1, 2.4, 3)
  Suggestion: Reconcile to 6 steps across all representations
- [warning] actionlint validation not mentioned in P0 Step 6 Apply, despite spec Section 7 recommending it (at: Section 2.4 Step 6)
  Suggestion: Add note to suggest actionlint after YAML writes
- [warning] security-checklist.md only shows example entries for items 1 and 3; items 4-8 need detection patterns (at: Section 2.6)
  Suggestion: Add brief detection descriptions for all 8 items
- [suggestion] gh run list --status failure filter not mentioned for failure-specific queries (at: Section 2.4 Step 1)
- [suggestion] No file encoding/line ending expectations stated (at: Section 6)

**Changes Made:**
1. Fixed P0 component model to show all 6 steps (added Step 2: Identify failure run)
2. Added actionlint suggestion to P0 Step 6 (Apply) description
3. Added detection patterns for all 8 anti-patterns in security-checklist.md design (items 4-8 were missing)
4. Updated token budget estimates to reflect expanded security-checklist.md (~80 lines)

**Summary:** Design is comprehensive and ready for planning. All components defined, interfaces specified, dependencies identified, risks noted. No blockers.
