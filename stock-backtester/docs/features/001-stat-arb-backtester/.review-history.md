## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-07T00:00:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (3 blockers, 8 warnings, 5 suggestions)

**Blockers:**
- [blocker] [assumptions] yfinance `auto_adjust=True` returns adjusted OHLC in 'Close' column, no separate 'Adj Close'. Spec assumed wrong column name.
  Suggestion: Use auto_adjust=True explicitly, remove Adj Close references.
- [blocker] [testability] ddof unspecified for Kelly estimator — pandas defaults to ddof=1 but test fixture assumes ddof=0. AC-4 would fail.
  Suggestion: Specify ddof=0 in both estimator and test.
- [blocker] [assumptions] Commission formula `commission_per_share * |delta_w| * close_price` has wrong units ($^2/share^2). Needs dimensional fix.
  Suggestion: Convert to fractional cost: commission_rate = commission_per_share / close_price.

**Warnings:**
- [warning] [traceability] Report format should enumerate exact fields for TABLE output.
- [warning] [testability] Net return formula units not clarified — slippage subtracted from log-returns needs unit consistency.
- [warning] [assumptions] Monte Carlo ruin detection scales returns but not costs — optimistic approximation.
- [warning] [clarity] SMA warmup_bars vs warmup_end_idx relationship unclear.
- [warning] [testability] AC-7 Sharpe computation method ambiguous (per-path vs ensemble).
- [warning] [scope] Module count says "seven" but lists nine.
- [warning] [assumptions] OHLCV adjustment status in data contract contradicts auto_adjust=True behavior.
- [warning] [clarity] Dependency graph shows report depending on metrics/kelly, but actual dependency is on types.py.

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed all 3 blockers: yfinance auto_adjust, ddof=0 convention, commission formula with dimensional analysis
- Fixed all 8 warnings: module count, dependency graph, report field enumeration, net return formula, MC leverage caveat, SMA warmup clarification, AC-7 method, OHLCV schema
- Addressed suggestions: NFR test file added, date range defaults, data/Kelly validation distinction, reproducibility metadata deferred
- Bumped spec to v2

## Stage 2: Phase Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-07T00:00:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (0 blockers, 4 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Warnings:**
- [warning] AlwaysLongStrategy warmup=0 interaction with shift(1) not explicit in AC-1
- [warning] Synthetic DataFrame construction for simulation paths not specified
- [warning] Annualized return convention (log vs geometric) ambiguous
- [warning] Equity curve formula not explicit

**Changes Made:**
- Added AlwaysLongStrategy warmup note to AC-1
- Added synthetic DataFrame spec to run_monte_carlo
- Clarified annualized return as geometric: exp(mean_log * 252) - 1
- Added equity curve formula: exp(cumsum(net_returns))
