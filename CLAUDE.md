## Project Overview

This is a VICI Claude Code 7-Day Challenge assessment project. The goal is to demonstrate engineering design thinking, code quality, and AI tool integration.

## Challenge Options

Choose one task to implement:

- **Easy**: US Stock Backtesting System (美股回測系統)
- **Medium**: Wrap Claude CLI as a LiteLLM endpoint, or wrap GitHub CI/CD as Claude Skills
- **Hard**: Browser automation tasks (e.g., Taiwan High Speed Rail ticket booking, NotebookLM presentation generation)
